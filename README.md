# CollaBroText Plugin Summary

This plugin is used to enhance collaboration between software developers working on same project remotely in Sublime Text.
Main functionality is commenting on a file in a similar way to how Google Docs does it.   
We are using git to keep the comments synced via Github or any other site you may wish to use for your project.

☐ Click on any highlight to view its comments.

☐ To sync your comments (background Git pull & push) press <kbd> Ctrl + s</kbd> (Normal save via keyboard)


## Important
1) Plugin only works if file present in ssh enabled git-versioned folder.
2) Make sure that <kbd>Alt + x</kbd>: Close comment tab is used to close the comments tab.
   DO NOT CLOSE COMMENTS TAB MANUALLY by clicking on close button
